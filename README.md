# Trunk

This is the main body of code for my master's thesis project. You can read more about it [here](https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/10405/). 

PinnNew folder Contains most of the completed projects. There are a few notebooks in there that we started for trying out ideas that did not work but we have kept them as we may return to them later. 

Note that this work was done in collaboration with computer scientists. You can see more of their work [here](https://github.com/nimahsn/pinns_tf2).
